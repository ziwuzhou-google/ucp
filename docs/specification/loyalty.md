# Loyalty Extension

## Overview

The loyalty extension is designed to facilitate high-fidelity loyalty experiences:
ensuring existing loyalty members can seamlessly access their benefits during agentic
Catalog, Cart, and Checkout experiences. By enabling buyers to see their specific tier,
eligible rewards, and immediately applicable benefits before finalizing a purchase, it
addresses a foundational expectation for program members and removes friction from the
checkout funnel.

Specifically the following core use cases of benefit recognition for known members are
addressed:

* Price-Impacting Benefits: Real-time application of member-only discounts and free
  shipping offers with clear attribution of benefit sources, including multiplicative
  benefits unlocked by concurrent memberships.
* Non-Price Benefits: Transparent display of rewards earned or rewards applicable to
  future purchases.
* Status Recognition: Verification and display of the buyers’ specific loyalty tier within
  a program.

## Key Concepts

Loyalty has four main components:

**Memberships**: Distinct enrollment pathways or program categories that a user can join

* Independent programs offered by the same brand (e.g., a "Rewards Club" vs. a "Co-branded
  Credit Card") are modeled as separate, independently verifiable memberships. They are
  programmatically represented as separate sibling top-level keys in the loyalty extension
  map, namespaced by reverse-domain naming.

**Tiers**: Specific achievement ranks or status milestones within a membership that
unlock escalating value as a member progresses through activity or spend

* A member typically holds a single active tier per membership. For programs with parallel
  status dimensions (e.g., holding both "Gold" and "Lifetime Platinum"), multiple tiers
  can be active concurrently.

**Benefits**: Ongoing perks and privileges granted to a customer based on their current
tier or membership status

* Contains both delayed (e.g. “Members have access to dedicated customer service”) and
  immediate-value (e.g. “Members get 5% off”) benefits.

**Rewards**: Quantifiable loyalty value that may be earned from the current transaction.
Note: Redeemable balances and stored value are modeled by the negotiated payment
instrument or a future redemption capability, not by this loyalty extension.

* One membership can offer multiple types of accumulable/collectable rewards, each having
  its own usage and redemption rules.

## Discovery

Businesses can follow standard advertisement mechanism to advertise loyalty support in
the Business profile. Currently the loyalty extension can decorate catalog search,
catalog lookup, cart, and checkout capabilities. Businesses MAY advertise loyalty
support for any subset of these capabilities. Platforms SHOULD check which resources are
extended.

## Loyalty behavior

The loyalty extension holds a key-value map whose keys are reverse-domain identifiers —
same convention as services, capabilities, and payment handlers in the business profile,
and represent eligibility claims about loyalty memberships that businesses recognize.
The values contain detailed membership info corresponding to the claims, and
uses the `provisional` field to indicate the verification state when additional
verification is required.

Programs that can be joined independently MUST be modeled as separate sibling entries
under the loyalty map, distinguished by their reverse-domain naming.

Platforms MAY send buyer loyalty membership claims via `context.eligibility` in the
request to activate loyalty extension and claim for loyalty benefits. Alternatively,
when the buyer is authenticated and the business can determine loyalty membership from
the authenticated identity, businesses MAY populate the loyalty extension without an
explicit eligibility claim. In this case, the map key MUST be the same reverse-domain
identifier the business would accept as a claim value.

* When a business verifies a membership claim or determines membership from authenticated
  identity, it MUST return `provisional: false`. It also MUST populate the active tier(s)
  the buyer holds within the `tiers` array and SHOULD set `display_id` as a masked unique
  identifier of the buyer.
* When a membership claim in the request is recognized and accepted but not verified by
  the business, the business MUST return `provisional: true`. It MAY return display-safe
  tier context for the state accepted during the session, and MUST NOT return
  `display_id` until the membership is verified.
* When a membership claim in the request is accepted but cannot be verified, the business
  MUST communicate the failure via a recoverable `message` with `type: "error"` and
  `code: "eligibility_invalid"`. Platforms MAY then choose to remove the membership
  claim and proceed the checkout without loyalty benefits applied.

At checkout completion, all accepted but unverified loyalty claims MUST be resolved per
the [Eligibility Verification at Completion](checkout.md#eligibility-verification-at-completion)
contract defined in the checkout capability.

### Monetary loyalty benefits

Monetary price-impacting loyalty benefits (e.g. member pricing/shipping) can have
conditions beyond membership, such as saving $10 only after a $500+ purchase. Businesses
MUST evaluate those conditions before applying the benefit.

When the benefit applies, businesses MUST surface the price impact through the base
capability's price fields. Catalog responses use `price` / `list_price` and
`price_range` / `list_price_range`; cart and checkout responses use `totals` or
`line_items[].totals` with `type: "items_discount"` and `display_text` to attribute the
loyalty source when possible.

When the discount extension is active, businesses SHOULD also populate
`discounts.applied[]` for structured attribution. In that case, `eligibility` identifies
the claim or claims required for the discount. An eligibility array is conjunctive: all
listed claims are required. Disjunctive (any-of) eligibility MUST be modeled as separate
`discounts.applied[]` objects, one per independent path. If the discount still requires
verification, for example because one or more accepted loyalty claims remain unverified,
the corresponding applied discount MUST set `provisional: true`.

If the benefit does not apply, businesses SHOULD notify the buyer via messages with
`type: "warning"` and explain the inapplicability of those monetary loyalty benefits.
Businesses MUST NOT put inapplicable benefits in the discount extension. Instead they
MAY set them as part of `benefits` within the loyalty extension and set the `path` within
the warning message to reference back for additional context.

When loyalty membership claims are accepted, business MAY use `type: "info"` to explain
the effects of applied monetary loyalty benefits .

**Loyalty benefits message codes:**

| Type      | Code                           | When                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`    | `membership_benefit_eligible`  | Specific benefit confirmed applicable to this order     |
| `warning` | `membership_benefit_ineligible`| Benefit exists but conditions not met for this order    |

Building on the store loyalty card example from
[Eligibility Verification at Completion](checkout.md#eligibility-verification-at-completion),
and assume it offers one unconditional pricing discount on the product and one
conditional discount that current checkout cart fails to satisfy. Platform can surface
the first provisional discount with disclaimers like "verified at purchase" and
additionally show a warning message to disclose the inapplicability of the second
discount.

              "id": "cardholder",
              "name": "Store Cardholder"
            }
          ],
          "provisional": true
        }
      },
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "warning",
          "code": "membership_benefit_ineligible",
          "path": "$.loyalty['com.example.loyalty.store_card']",
          "content": "Cart size is smaller than required to receive the $10 discount."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

Buyer can proceed with checkout without any cart update and if the claim is verified
successfully by the business, the unconditional member pricing discount becomes
non-provisional, and `display_id` is returned.

          ],
          "provisional": false
        }
      }
    }
    ```

If the claim can not be verified, a recoverable error should be returned from business
via `messages[]`. Businesses MAY set the optional `path` field within to support back
referencing to the membership metadata that corresponds to the claim. In this case, the
loyalty extension needs to be included in the response as well.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "context": {
        "eligibility": ["com.example.loyalty.store_card"]
      },
      "line_items": [
        {
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_1",
            "quantity": 1,
            "title": "T-Shirt",
            "price": 1000
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "error",
          "severity": "recoverable",
          "code": "eligibility_invalid",
          "content": "Buyer is not a store card holder."
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Use Cases and Examples

With the help of the loyalty extension, the catalog, cart, and checkout capabilities can
be further decorated to provide full visibility into buyers’ member-exclusive perks and
allows the platform to render the extra information to facilitate the transaction.

### Compound Price-Impacting Benefits

Loyalty extension can provide buyer status info that helps the platform explain member
discounts. Price-impacting loyalty benefits are reflected in the base capability's
price fields. When the discount extension is also active, the platform can explain each
discount via `discounts.applied[].title` and correlate
`discounts.applied[].eligibility` back to `loyalty` entries to show which accepted
membership claims produced the monetary benefit. In the example below, the buyer
receives a 15% bonus discount because they hold BOTH the Retail Club membership and the
Retail Card, and the `eligibility` array reflects this conjunction natively. Platform
can then render “Retail Club Gold Member and Retail Card benefits applied.” for
example.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "context": {
        "eligibility": [
          "com.example.retail_club",

        ]
      },
      "line_items": [

    }
    ```

### Reward Earnings Forecast

In addition to immediate-value benefits like member pricing/shipping, delayed-value
collectable reward benefits are another crucial element within the loyalty ecosystem.
Displaying earnings forecasts of these rewards before the buyer commits complements and
to some extent helps agents handle price objections - rewards earning becomes additional
value on top of any pricing discount. In this example, businesses provide the reward
earning forecast with a breakdown, using `benefit_id` to correlate the specific
`membership_tier_benefit` that produced the rule and giving platforms a way to explain
with full transparency on why the buyer is earning and how the earning is calculated.

## Implementation guidelines

* Loyalty extension response MUST be data-minimized and MUST NOT expose raw stable member
  identifiers (as this would allow the platform to uniquely identifier individual buyer)
* Loyalty extension response MUST only include `display_id` after verified/authenticated
  membership
* Loyalty extension response MUST treat all `context.eligibility` values in the request as
  buyer claims rather than proof
