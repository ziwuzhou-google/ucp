# Discount Extension

## Overview

Discount extension allows businesses to indicate that they support discount
codes on cart and checkout sessions, and specifies how the discount codes are
to be shared between the platform and the business.

**Key features:**

- Submit one or more discount codes
- Receive applied discounts with human-readable titles and amounts
- Rejected codes communicated via `messages[]` with detailed error codes
- Automatic discounts surfaced alongside code-based discounts

**Dependencies:**

- Cart Capability or Checkout Capability

## Discovery

Businesses advertise discount support in their profile. The capability can
extend cart, checkout, or both:

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
    "capabilities": {
      "dev.ucp.shopping.discount": [
        {
          "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
          "extends": ["dev.ucp.shopping.cart", "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout"],
          "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/discount",
          "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/discount.json"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Businesses MAY advertise discount support for cart only, checkout only, or
both. Platforms SHOULD check which resources are extended before submitting
discount codes.

## Schema

When this capability is active, cart and/or checkout are extended with a
`discounts` object.

### Discounts Object

{{ extension_schema_fields('discount.json#/$defs/discounts_object', 'discount') }}

### Applied Discount

{{ extension_schema_fields('discount.json#/$defs/applied_discount', 'discount') }}

### Allocation

{{ extension_schema_fields('discount.json#/$defs/allocation', 'discount') }}

## Allocation Details

The `applied` array explains how discounts were calculated and distributed.
The `applied[].amount` describes the magnitude of the applied discount (always
positive); the corresponding `totals[]` entry amount represents its signed
effect on the receipt (negative for discounts).

### Allocation Method

The `method` field indicates how the discount was calculated:

| Method   | Meaning                                 | Example                                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `each`   | Applied independently per eligible item | "10% off each item" → 10% × item price           |
| `across` | Split proportionally by value           | "$10 off order" → $6 to $60 item, $4 to $40 item |

### Stacking Order

When multiple discounts are applied, `priority` indicates the calculation order.
Lower numbers are applied first:

```text
Cart: $100
Discount A (priority: 1): 20% off → $100 × 0.8 = $80
Discount B (priority: 2): $10 off → $80 - $10 = $70
```

The order matters because percentage discounts compound differently depending on
when they're applied.

### Allocations Array

The `allocations` array breaks down where each discount dollar landed, using
JSONPath to identify targets:

| Path Pattern        | Target           |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| `$.line_items[0]`   | First line item  |
| `$.line_items[1]`   | Second line item |
| `$.totals.shipping` | Shipping cost    |

This enables platforms to explain exactly how much each discount contributed to
each line item, even when multiple discounts stack.

**Invariant:** Sum of `allocations[].amount` equals `applied_discount.amount`.

## Operations

Discount codes are submitted via standard cart or checkout create/update
operations. The same semantics apply to both resources.

**Request behavior:**

- **Replacement semantics**: Submitting `discounts.codes` replaces any previously submitted codes
- **Clear codes**: Send empty array `"codes": []` to remove all discount codes
- **Case-insensitive**: Codes are matched case-insensitively by business

**Response behavior:**

- `discounts.applied` contains all active discounts (code-based + automatic)
- Rejected codes communicated via `messages[]` (see below)
- Discount amounts reflected in `totals[]` and `line_items[].totals[]`

**Cart-to-checkout continuity:** When a cart is converted to a checkout via the
cart capability's `cart_id` field, businesses MUST carry forward any discount
codes that were applied to the cart. Codes that are no longer valid at checkout
time (e.g., expired, ineligible) SHOULD be communicated via `messages[]` using
standard rejection codes.

## Rejected Codes

When a submitted discount code cannot be applied, businesses communicate this
via the `messages[]` array:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "warning",
      "code": "discount_code_expired",
      "path": "$.discounts.codes[0]",
      "content": "Code 'SUMMER20' expired on December 1st"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Implementation guidance:** Operations that affect order totals, or the
> user's expectation of the total, **SHOULD** use `type: "warning"` to ensure
> they are surfaced to the user rather than silently handled by platforms.
> Rejected discounts are a prime example—the user expects a discount but won't
> receive it, so they should be informed.

**Error codes for rejected discounts:**

| Code                                   | Description                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `discount_code_expired`                | Code has expired                            |
| `discount_code_invalid`                | Code not found or malformed                 |
| `discount_code_already_applied`        | Code is already applied                     |
| `discount_code_combination_disallowed` | Cannot combine with another active discount |
| `discount_code_user_not_logged_in`     | Code requires authenticated user            |
| `discount_code_user_ineligible`        | User does not meet eligibility criteria     |

## Automatic Discounts

Businesses may apply discounts automatically based on cart contents, customer
segment, or promotional rules:

- Appear in `discounts.applied` with `automatic: true` and no `code` field
- Applied without platform action
- Cannot be removed by the platform
- Surfaced for transparency (platform can explain to user why discount was applied)

## Eligibility Claims

Eligibility claims are buyer claims about eligible benefits (see
[Context](checkout.md#context)) such as loyalty membership, payment instrument
perks, and similar. When the discount extension is active, Businesses that
choose to accept eligibility claims **MUST** surface their effect on pricing
as provisional discounts in the `applied` array. Platforms **MUST** display
provisional discounts to the buyer.

### Discount Behavior

Platforms send buyer claims via `context.eligibility` on cart or checkout
requests (see [Context](checkout.md#context)). When a Business recognizes a
claim and it affects pricing, it **MUST** surface a corresponding provisional
discount in the `discounts.applied` array. This gives the Platform structured
attribution to display to the buyer.

Eligibility-triggered discounts use the following fields:

| Field         | Value                                                | Purpose                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `automatic`   | `true`                                               | No code required                         |
| `provisional` | `true`                                               | Requires verification at completion      |
| `eligibility` | `"com.example.store_card"` *or* `["...", "..."]`     | The accepted claim(s) (see below)        |
| `code`        | *(omitted)*                                          | Not code-based                           |

Standard `priority`, `method`, and `allocations` fields apply for stacking with
other discounts.

#### Conjunctive eligibility

For multiplicative benefits unlocked only when the buyer holds two or more
programs simultaneously, `eligibility` **MUST** be an array of every claim
required. Semantics are conjunctive (ALL listed claims required):

```json
{
  "title": "Loyalty + Card Bonus 2%",
  "amount": 100,
  "automatic": true,
  "eligibility": ["com.example.loyalty", "com.example.loyalty.card"]
}
```

Disjunctive (any-of) eligibility **SHOULD** be modeled as separate `applied`
entries, one per claim that independently unlocks the benefit.

### Verification at Checkout

Discounts from accepted but unverified claims carry `provisional: true`.
Provisional discounts remain until the claim is verified, rescinded, or
replaced during the session. At checkout completion, all remaining provisional
claims **MUST** be resolved (see
[Eligibility Verification at Completion](checkout.md#eligibility-verification-at-completion)).

### Example: Provisional Discount with Attribution

Building on the store card example from
[Eligibility Verification at Completion](checkout.md#eligibility-verification-at-completion),
the discount extension provides structured attribution. The Platform claims a
store card benefit; the Business surfaces the provisional discount with full
stacking and allocation details:

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "context": {
        "eligibility": ["com.example.store_card"]
      },
      "line_items": [
        {
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_shirt"
          },
          "quantity": 2
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "applied": [
          {
            "title": "Store Card 5% Off",
            "amount": 250,
            "automatic": true,
            "provisional": true,
            "eligibility": "com.example.store_card",
            "priority": 1,
            "method": "each",
            "allocations": [
              {"path": "$.line_items[0]", "amount": 250}
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 5000},
        {"type": "items_discount", "display_text": "Discounts", "amount": -250},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 4750}
      ]
    }
    ```

The Platform can now render: "Store Card 5% Off: -$2.50 *(verified at
purchase)*" with full confidence in the attribution, amount, and allocation.

## Impact on Line Items and Totals

Applied discounts are reflected in the core cart or checkout fields using two
distinct total types:

| Total Type       | When to Use                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `items_discount` | Discounts allocated to line items (`$.line_items[*]`)     |
| `discount`       | Order-level discounts (shipping, fees, flat order amount) |

**Determining the type:** If a discount has `allocations` pointing to line
items, it contributes to `items_discount`. Discounts without allocations, or
with allocations to shipping/fees, contribute to `discount`.

| Discount Type        | Where Reflected                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Line-item discount   | `line_items[].totals[type=items_discount]` |
| Order-level discount | `totals[type=discount]`                    |

**Invariant:** `totals[type=items_discount].amount` equals
`sum(line_items[].totals[type=items_discount].amount)`.

The `discounts.applied` array shows **what** was applied. The `totals[]` and
`line_items[].totals[]` show **where** and **how much**.

**Amount convention:** Discount amounts in `discounts.applied` are positive
integers (the value of the discount). Discount entries in `totals[]` are
negative (the effect on the receipt) — the sign is schema-enforced.

## Examples

### Cart with discount codes

Discount codes applied during cart exploration. The cart response includes
estimated discount amounts, giving the buyer visibility into savings before
proceeding to checkout.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "line_items": [
        {
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_1",
          },
          "quantity": 2
        }
      ],
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SUMMER20"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "id": "cart_abc123",
      "line_items": [
        {
          "id": "li_1",
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_1",
            "title": "T-Shirt",
            "price": 2000
          },
          "quantity": 2,
          "totals": [
            {"type": "subtotal", "amount": 4000},
            {"type": "items_discount", "amount": -800},
            {"type": "total", "amount": 3200}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SUMMER20"],
        "applied": [
          {
            "code": "SUMMER20",
            "title": "Summer Sale 20% Off",
            "amount": 800,
            "method": "each",
            "allocations": [
              {"path": "$.line_items[0]", "amount": 800}
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "currency": "USD",
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 4000},
        {"type": "items_discount", "display_text": "Item Discounts", "amount": -800},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Estimated Total", "amount": 3200}
      ]
    }
    ```

### Order-level discount

A flat discount applied to the order total. No allocations—the discount applies
to the order as a whole and uses `type: "discount"` in totals.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SAVE10"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SAVE10"],
        "applied": [
          {
            "code": "SAVE10",
            "title": "$10 Off Your Order",
            "amount": 1000
          }
        ]
      },
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 5000},
        {"type": "discount", "display_text": "Order Discount", "amount": -1000},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 4000}
      ]
    }
    ```

### Mixed discounts (item + order level)

This example shows both discount types: a per-item discount (20% off) allocated
to line items, and an automatic shipping discount at the order level.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SUMMER20"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "line_items": [
        {
          "id": "li_1",
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_1",
            "title": "T-Shirt",
            "price": 2000
          },
          "quantity": 2,
          "totals": [
            {"type": "subtotal", "amount": 4000},
            {"type": "items_discount", "amount": -800},
            {"type": "total", "amount": 3200}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SUMMER20"],
        "applied": [
          {
            "code": "SUMMER20",
            "title": "Summer Sale 20% Off",
            "amount": 800,
            "allocations": [
              {"path": "$.line_items[0]", "amount": 800}
            ]
          },
          {
            "title": "Free shipping on orders over $30",
            "amount": 599,
            "automatic": true
          }
        ]
      },
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 4000},
        {"type": "items_discount", "display_text": "Item Discounts", "amount": -800},
        {"type": "discount", "display_text": "Order Discounts", "amount": -599},
        {"type": "fulfillment", "display_text": "Shipping", "amount": 0},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 2601}
      ]
    }
    ```

### Rejected discount code

When a discount code cannot be applied, the rejection is communicated via the
`messages[]` array. The code still appears in `discounts.codes` (echoed back)
but not in `discounts.applied`.

=== "Request"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SAVE10", "EXPIRED50"]
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SAVE10", "EXPIRED50"],
        "applied": [
          {
            "code": "SAVE10",
            "title": "$10 Off Your Order",
            "amount": 1000
          }
        ]
      },
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 5000},
        {"type": "discount", "display_text": "Order Discount", "amount": -1000},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 4000}
      ],
      "messages": [
        {
          "type": "warning",
          "code": "discount_code_expired",
          "path": "$.discounts.codes[1]",
          "content": "Code 'EXPIRED50' expired on December 1st"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Stacked discounts with allocations

Multiple discounts applied with full allocation breakdown:

=== "Response"

    ```json
    {
      "line_items": [
        {
          "id": "li_1",
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_1",
            "title": "T-Shirt",
            "price": 6000
          },
          "quantity": 1,
          "totals": [
            {"type": "subtotal", "amount": 6000},
            {"type": "items_discount", "amount": -1500},
            {"type": "total", "amount": 4500}
          ]
        },
        {
          "id": "li_2",
          "item": {
            "id": "prod_2",
            "title": "Socks",
            "price": 4000
          },
          "quantity": 1,
          "totals": [
            {"type": "subtotal", "amount": 4000},
            {"type": "items_discount", "amount": -1000},
            {"type": "total", "amount": 3000}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "discounts": {
        "codes": ["SUMMER20", "LOYALTY5"],
        "applied": [
          {
            "code": "SUMMER20",
            "title": "Summer Sale 20% Off",
            "amount": 2000,
            "method": "each",
            "priority": 1,
            "allocations": [
              {"path": "$.line_items[0]", "amount": 1200},
              {"path": "$.line_items[1]", "amount": 800}
            ]
          },
          {
            "code": "LOYALTY5",
            "title": "$5 Loyalty Reward",
            "amount": 500,
            "method": "across",
            "priority": 2,
            "allocations": [
              {"path": "$.line_items[0]", "amount": 300},
              {"path": "$.line_items[1]", "amount": 200}
            ]
          }
        ]
      },
      "totals": [
        {"type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 10000},
        {"type": "items_discount", "display_text": "Item Discounts", "amount": -2500},
        {"type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 7500}
      ]
    }
