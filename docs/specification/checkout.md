# Checkout Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`

## Overview

Allows platforms to facilitate checkout sessions. The checkout has to be
finalized manually by the user through a trusted UI unless the AP2 Mandates
extension is supported.

The business remains the Merchant of Record (MoR), and they don't need to become
PCI DSS compliant to accept card payments through this Capability.

### Flow overview

![High-level checkout flow sequence diagram](site:specification/images/ucp-checkout-flow.png)

### Payments

Payment handlers are discovered from the business's UCP profile at
`/.well-known/ucp` and checkout.ucp.payment_handlers. The handlers define
the processing specifications for collecting payment instruments
(e.g., Google Pay, Shop Pay). When the buyer submits payment, the platform
populates the `payment.instruments` array with the collected instrument data.

The `payment` object is optional on checkout creation and may be omitted for
use cases that don't require payment processing (e.g., quote generation, cart
management).

### Fulfillment

Fulfillment is modelled as an extension in UCP to account for diverse use cases.

Fulfillment is optional in the checkout object. This is done to enable a
platform to perform checkout for digital goods without needing to furnish
fulfillment details more relevant for physical goods.

### Checkout Status Lifecycle

The checkout `status` field indicates the current phase of the session and
determines what action is required next. The business sets the status; the
platform receives messages indicating what's needed to progress.

                               +-------------+
          (session invalid/expired - can occur from any state)
```

### Status Values

* **`incomplete`**: Checkout session is missing required information or has
    issues that need resolution. Platform should inspect `messages` array for
    context and should attempt to resolve via Update Checkout.

* **`requires_escalation`**: Checkout session requires information that
    cannot be provided via API, or buyer input is required. Platform should
    inspect `messages` to understand what's needed (see Error Handling below).
    If any `recoverable` errors exist, resolve those first.
    Then hand off to buyer via `continue_url`.

* **`ready_for_complete`**: Checkout session has all necessary information
    and platform can finalize programmatically. Platform can call
    Complete Checkout.

* **`complete_in_progress`**: Business is processing the Complete Checkout
    request.

* **`completed`**: Order placed successfully.

* **`canceled`**: Checkout session is invalid or expired. Platform should
    start a new checkout session if needed.

### Error Handling

The `messages` array contains errors, warnings, and informational messages
about the checkout state. `ucp.status` is the shape discriminator —
`"success"` means the response carries the expected payload, `"error"`
means it carries error information instead. The `severity` field on each
error message prescribes the recommended action:

| Severity                | Meaning                                          | Platform Action                                                   |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `recoverable`           | Platform can resolve by modifying inputs via API | Update resource and retry                                         |
| `requires_buyer_input`  | Business requires input not available via API    | Hand off via `continue_url`                                       |
| `requires_buyer_review` | Buyer review and authorization is required       | Hand off via `continue_url`                                       |
| `unrecoverable`         | No resource exists to act on                     | Retry with new resource or inputs, or hand off via `continue_url` |

Errors with `requires_*` severity contribute to `status: requires_escalation`.
Both result in buyer handoff, but represent different checkout states.

* `requires_buyer_input` means the checkout is **incomplete** — the business
requires information their API doesn't support collecting programmatically.
* `requires_buyer_review` means the checkout is **complete** — but policy,
regulatory, or entitlement rules require buyer authorization before order
placement (e.g., high-value order approval, first-purchase policy).

When the business cannot create a new resource or the requested resource
no longer exists, the response contains `ucp.status: "error"` with
`messages` describing the failure — no resource is included in the
response body. When no resource exists to act on, messages SHOULD use
`severity: "unrecoverable"`.
For example, a business may reject a create checkout request where all
items are unavailable:

```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "2026-01-11", "status": "error" },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "out_of_stock",
      "content": "All requested items are currently out of stock",
      "severity": "unrecoverable"
    }
  ],
  "continue_url": "https://merchant.com/"
}
```

See [REST](checkout-rest.md#create-checkout) and
[MCP](checkout-mcp.md#create_checkout) binding examples.

#### Error Processing Algorithm

When status is `incomplete` or `requires_escalation`, platforms should process
errors as a prioritized stack. The example below illustrates a checkout with
three error types: a recoverable error (invalid phone), a buyer input
requirement (delivery scheduling), and a review requirement (high-value order).
The latter two require handoff and serve as explicit signals to the platform.
Businesses **SHOULD** surface such messages as early as possible, and platforms
**SHOULD** prioritize resolving recoverable errors before initiating handoff.

```json
{
  "status": "requires_escalation",
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "invalid_phone",
      "severity": "recoverable",
      "content": "Phone number format is invalid"
    },
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "schedule_delivery",
      "severity": "requires_buyer_input",
      "content": "Select delivery window for your purchase"
    },
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "high_value_order",
      "severity": "requires_buyer_review",
      "content": "Orders over $500 require additional verification"
    }
  ]
}
```

Example error processing algorithm:

```text
GIVEN response with messages array

FILTER errors FROM messages WHERE type = "error"

PARTITION errors INTO
  recoverable           WHERE severity = "recoverable"
  requires_buyer_input  WHERE severity = "requires_buyer_input"
  requires_buyer_review WHERE severity = "requires_buyer_review"
  unrecoverable         WHERE severity = "unrecoverable"

IF unrecoverable is not empty
  RETRY with new resource or inputs, or hand off via continue_url
  RETURN

IF recoverable is not empty
  FOR EACH error IN recoverable
    ATTEMPT to fix error (e.g., reformat phone number)
  CALL Update Checkout
  RETURN and re-evaluate response

IF requires_buyer_input is not empty
  handoff_context = "incomplete, additional input from buyer is required"
ELSE IF requires_buyer_review is not empty
  handoff_context = "ready for final review by the buyer"
```

#### Standard Errors

Standard errors are standardized error codes that platforms are expected to
handle with specific, appropriate UX rather than generic error treatment.

| Code                     | Description                                                                |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `out_of_stock`           | Specific item or variant is unavailable                                    |
| `item_unavailable`       | Item cannot be purchased (e.g. delisted)                                   |
| `address_undeliverable`  | Cannot deliver to the provided address                                     |
| `payment_failed`         | Payment processing failed                                                  |
| `eligibility_invalid`    | Eligibility claim could not be verified at completion                      |

Businesses **SHOULD** mark standard errors with `severity: recoverable` to
signal that platforms should provide appropriate UX (out-of-stock messaging,
address validation prompts, payment method changes) rather than generic error
messages or deferring to checkout completion.

Example: `out_of_stock` requires specific upfront UX, whereas
`payment_required` can be handled generically at submission.

#### Eligibility Verification at Completion

Platforms provide `context.eligibility` — buyer claims about eligible benefits
such as loyalty membership, payment instrument perks, and similar. These are
claims, not verified facts. Businesses **MAY** act on recognized claims during
the session (adjusting pricing, granting product access, applying provisional
discounts), but all accepted claims **MUST** be resolved before the
transaction can complete.

Unrecognized or inapplicable claims **MUST NOT** block the checkout.
Businesses **SHOULD** notify the buyer via `messages` with `type: "warning"`
when a claim is not accepted, and **MAY** use `type: "info"` to explain
the effects of accepted claims. At completion, accepted claims that remain
unverified **MUST** result in `type: "error"` with
`code: "eligibility_invalid"` (see below).

**Eligibility message codes:**

| Type      | Code                       | When                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `warning` | `eligibility_not_accepted` | Claim not recognized or not applicable             |
| `info`    | `eligibility_accepted`     | Effect of an accepted claim                        |
| `error`   | `eligibility_invalid`      | Accepted claim could not be verified at completion |

A claim is resolved when it is either **verified** or **rescinded**:

* **Verified**: The Business confirms the claim against a proof provided at
  completion time. UCP does not prescribe how verification occurs — proof
  may come from the payment credential, an identity verification capability,
  or any other mechanism negotiated between Platform and Business.
* **Rescinded**: The Platform removes the claim from `context.eligibility`
  before completion (e.g., buyer changes payment method, withdraws a
  membership claim). Once removed, the Business recalculates without it.

Businesses **MUST NOT** complete a transaction with unresolved eligibility
claims. Unverified claims may result in incorrect pricing or unauthorized
access to restricted products.

**When verification fails:**

Verification failure **MUST** only affect the `messages` array. The
Business **MUST** return an error in `messages` with
`code: "eligibility_invalid"` and `severity: "recoverable"`. Messages
**SHOULD** use the `path` field to identify which specific claim(s) could
not be verified. The Platform **MAY** then provide valid proof and
resubmit, restructure the checkout (e.g., remove ineligible items, update
claims), or abandon the attempt.

For example, the Platform claims a store card benefit via
`context.eligibility`. The Business applies member pricing during the session.
At completion, the payment credential does not match the claimed instrument:

```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "2026-01-11", "status": "success" },
  "id": "checkout_abc",
  "status": "ready_for_complete",
  "line_items": [ "..." ],
  "totals": [ "..." ],
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "eligibility_invalid",
      "severity": "recoverable",
      "content": "Payment credential does not match the claimed store card benefit.",
      "path": "$.context.eligibility[0]"
    }
  ]
}
```

The Platform can resolve this by having the buyer switch to the qualifying
payment instrument, or by removing the claim from `context.eligibility` to
renegotiate the checkout (obtaining updated pricing, availability, etc.)
and then resubmitting for completion.

### Warning Presentation

The `presentation` field on warning messages controls the rendering
contract the platform **MUST** follow. When omitted, it defaults to
`"notice"`.

| | `notice` (default) | `disclosure` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Display content | **MUST** | **MUST** |
| Proximity to `path` | **MAY** | **MUST** |
| Dismissible | **MAY** | **MUST NOT** |
| Render `image_url` | **MAY** | **MUST** |
| Render `url` | **MAY** | **SHOULD** |
| Escalate if cannot honor | — | **MUST** via `continue_url` |

#### `notice` (default)

The default rendering contract for warnings. Platforms **MUST** display
the warning content to the buyer. Platforms **MAY** render notices in a
banner, tray, or toast, and **MAY** allow the buyer to dismiss them.

#### `disclosure`

Warnings with `presentation: "disclosure"` carry notices — safety
warnings, allergen declarations, compliance content, etc. — that
**MUST** follow the prescribed rendering contract below.

**Platform requirements:**

* **MUST** display the warning `content` to the buyer.
* **MUST** display the warning in proximity to the component referenced
  by `path`, preserving the association between the disclosure and its
  subject. When `path` is omitted, the disclosure applies to the response
  as a whole.
* **MUST NOT** hide, collapse, or auto-dismiss the warning.
* **MUST** render `image_url` when present (e.g., warning symbol,
  energy class label).
* **SHOULD** render `url` as a navigable reference link when present.

Warnings with `presentation: "disclosure"` **SHOULD** be given rendering
priority over notices.

Platforms that cannot honor the disclosure rendering contract **MUST**
escalate to merchant UI via `continue_url` rather than silently
downgrading to a notice.

**Business requirements:**

* **MUST** set `presentation: "disclosure"` when the warning content must
  be displayed alongside a specific component and must not be hidden or
  auto-dismissed.
* **SHOULD** use the `path` field to associate disclosures with the
  relevant component in the response.
* **SHOULD** provide a `code` that identifies the disclosure category
  (e.g., `prop65`, `allergens`, `energy_label`).
* **SHOULD** provide `image_url` when the disclosure has an associated
  visual element (e.g., warning symbol, energy class label).
* **SHOULD** provide `url` when a reference link is available for the
  buyer to learn more.

#### Disclosure and Acknowledgment

The `presentation` field controls how the warning is rendered, not
whether the checkout can proceed. When affirmative buyer acknowledgment
or authorization is also required, the business **MAY** combine the
disclosure with the escalation mechanisms described in the
[Checkout Status Lifecycle](#checkout-status-lifecycle) to ensure the
appropriate buyer input is obtained.

#### Jurisdiction and Applicability

It is the business's responsibility to determine which disclosures apply
to a given session and return only those that are relevant. Businesses
**SHOULD** use buyer-provided data (`context` and other inputs) and
product attributes to resolve jurisdiction-specific requirements.
Platforms do not affect or resolve disclosure applicability — they render
what they receive from the business.

#### Example

A checkout response containing both a recoverable error and a disclosure
warning on a line item:

```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "{{ ucp_version }}", "status": "success" },
  "id": "chk_abc123",
  "status": "incomplete",
  "currency": "USD",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "id": "li_1",
      "item": { "id": "item_456", "title": "Artisan Nut Butter Collection", "image_url": "https://merchant.com/nut-butter.jpg" },
      "quantity": 1,
      "totals": [{ "type": "subtotal", "amount": 1299 }]
    }
  ],
  "totals": [{ "type": "total", "amount": 1299 }],
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "field_required",
      "path": "$.buyer.email",
      "content": "Buyer email is required",
      "severity": "recoverable"
    },
    {
      "type": "warning",
      "code": "allergens",
      "path": "$.line_items[0]",
      "content": "**Contains: tree nuts.** Produced in a facility that also processes peanuts, milk, and soy.",
      "content_type": "markdown",
      "presentation": "disclosure",
      "image_url": "https://merchant.com/allergen-tree-nuts.svg",
      "url": "https://merchant.com/allergen-info"
    }
  ],
  "links": []
}
```

The platform resolves the recoverable error programmatically while
rendering the allergen disclosure in proximity to the referenced line
item.

## Continue URL

The `continue_url` field enables checkout handoff from platform to business UI,
allowing the buyer to continue and finalize the checkout session.

### Availability

Businesses **MUST** provide `continue_url` when returning `status` =
`requires_escalation`. For all other non-terminal statuses (`incomplete`,
`ready_for_complete`, `complete_in_progress`), businesses **SHOULD** provide
`continue_url`. For terminal states (`completed`, `canceled`), `continue_url`
**SHOULD** be omitted.

### Format

The `continue_url` **MUST** be an absolute HTTPS URL and **SHOULD** preserve
checkout state for seamless handoff. Businesses **MAY** implement state
preservation using either approach:

#### Server-Side State (Recommended)

An opaque URL backed by server-side checkout state:

```text
https://business.example.com/checkout-sessions/{checkout_id}
```

* Server maintains checkout state tied to `checkout_id`
* Simple, secure, recommended for most implementations
* URL lifetime typically tied to `expires_at`

#### Checkout Permalink

A stateless URL that encodes checkout state directly, allowing reconstruction
without server-side persistence. Businesses **SHOULD** implement support for
this format to facilitate checkout handoff and accelerated entry—for example, a
platform can prefill checkout state when initiating a buy-now flow.

> **Note:** Checkout permalinks are a REST-specific construct that extends the
> [REST transport binding](checkout-rest.md). Accessing a permalink returns a
> redirect to the checkout UI or renders the checkout page directly.

## Scopes

The Checkout capability defines the following well-known scopes for
user-authenticated access:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `dev.ucp.shopping.checkout:manage` | All checkout operations on behalf of the authenticated user — create, update, complete, and cancel checkout sessions. |

Scope declaration, derivation, and rules for extending this set with
custom scopes are defined in [Identity Linking — Scopes](identity-linking.md#scopes).

## Guidelines

(In addition to the overarching guidelines)

### Platform

* **MAY** engage an agent to facilitate the checkout session (e.g. add items
    to the checkout session, select fulfillment address). However, the
    agent must hand over the checkout session to a trusted and
    deterministic UI for the user to review the checkout details and place the
    order.
* **MAY** send the user from the trusted, deterministic UI back to the agent
    at any time. For example, when the user decides to exit the checkout screen
    to keep adding items to the cart.
* **MAY** provide agent context when the platform indicates that the request
    was done by an agent.
* **MUST** use `continue_url` when checkout status is `requires_escalation`.
* **MAY** use `continue_url` to hand off to business UI in other situations.
* When performing handoff, **SHOULD** prefer business-provided
    `continue_url` over platform-constructed checkout permalinks.

### Business

* **MUST** send a confirmation email after the checkout has been completed.
* **SHOULD** provide accurate error messages.
* Logic handling the checkout sessions **MUST** be deterministic.
* **MUST** provide `continue_url` when returning `status` =
    `requires_escalation`.
* **MUST** include at least one message with `severity` of
    `requires_buyer_input` or `requires_buyer_review` when returning
    `status` = `requires_escalation`.
* **SHOULD** provide `continue_url` in all non-terminal checkout responses.
* After a checkout session reaches the state "completed", it is considered
    immutable.

## Capability Schema Definition <span id="checkout"></span>

{{ schema_fields('checkout_resp', 'checkout') }}

## Operations

The Checkout capability defines the following logical operations.

| Operation             | Description                                                                        |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create Checkout**   | Initiates a new checkout session. Called as soon as a user adds an item to a cart. |
| **Get Checkout**      | Retrieves the current state of a checkout session.                                 |
| **Update Checkout**   | Updates a checkout session.                                                        |
| **Complete Checkout** | Finalizes the checkout and places the order.                                       |
| **Cancel Checkout**   | Cancels a checkout session.                                                        |

### Create Checkout

To be invoked by the platform when the user has expressed purchase intent
(e.g., click on Buy) to initiate the checkout session with the item details.

**Recommendation**: To minimize discrepancies and a streamlined user experience,
product data (price/title etc.) provided by the business through the feeds
**SHOULD** match the actual attributes returned in the response.

{{ method_fields('create_checkout', 'rest.openapi.json', 'checkout') }}

### Get Checkout

It provides the latest state of the checkout resource. After cancellation or
completion it is up to the business on what to return (i.e this can be a long
lived state or expire after a particular TTL - resulting in a 'not found'
error). From the platform there is no specific enforcement for a TTL of the
checkout.

The platform will honor the TTL provided by the business via `expires_at` at the
time of checkout session creation.

{{ method_fields('get_checkout', 'rest.openapi.json', 'checkout') }}

### Update Checkout

Performs a full replacement of the checkout resource.
The platform is **REQUIRED** to send the entire checkout resource containing any
data updates to write-only data fields. The resource provided in the request
will replace the existing checkout session state on the business side.

{{ method_fields('update_checkout', 'rest.openapi.json', 'checkout') }}

### Complete Checkout

This is the final checkout placement call. To be invoked when the user has
committed to pay and place an order for the chosen items. The response of this
call is the checkout object with the `order` field populated in it. The returned
`order` provides necessary identifiers, such as `id` and `permalink_url`,
that can be used to reference the full state of the placed order.
At the time of order persistence, fields from `Checkout` **MAY** be used
to construct the order representation (i.e. information like `line_items`,
`fulfillment` will be used to create the initial order representation).

After this call, other details will be updated through subsequent events
as the order, and its associated items, moves through the supply chain.

### Cancel Checkout

This operation will be used to cancel a checkout session, if it can be canceled.
If the checkout session cannot be canceled (e.g. checkout session is
already canceled or completed), then businesses **SHOULD** send back an error
indicating the operation is not allowed. Any checkout session with a status
that is not equal to `completed` or `canceled` **SHOULD** be cancelable.

## Transport Bindings

The abstract operations above are bound to specific transport protocols as
defined below:

* [REST Binding](checkout-rest.md): RESTful API mapping using standard HTTP verbs and JSON payloads.
* [MCP Binding](checkout-mcp.md): Model Context Protocol mapping for agentic interaction.
* [A2A Binding](checkout-a2a.md): Agent-to-Agent Protocol mapping for agentic interactions.
* [Embedded Checkout Binding](embedded-checkout.md): JSON-RPC for powering embedded checkout.

## Entities

### Buyer

{{ schema_fields('buyer', 'checkout') }}

### Context

Context signals are provisional—not authoritative data. Businesses SHOULD use
these values when verified inputs (e.g., shipping address) are absent, and MAY
ignore or down-rank them if inconsistent with higher-confidence signals
(authenticated account, risk detection) or regulatory constraints (export
controls). Eligibility and policy enforcement MUST occur at checkout time using
binding transaction data.

{{ schema_fields('context', 'checkout') }}

### Signals

Environment data provided by the platform to support authorization
and abuse prevention. Unlike `context` (buyer-asserted preferences) and `buyer`
(self-reported identity), signal values MUST NOT be buyer-asserted claims —
platforms provide signals based on direct observation or by relaying
independently verifiable third-party attestations. See
[Signals](overview.md#signals) for details and privacy
requirements.

{{ schema_fields('types/signals', 'checkout') }}

### Attribution

Platform-provided referral and conversion-event context — campaign IDs,
click identifiers, and source/medium markers communicated by the platform.
See [Attribution](overview.md#attribution) for details and consent
requirements.

#### Well-Known Link Types

Businesses **SHOULD** provide all relevant links for the transaction. The
following are the recommended well-known types:

| Type               | Description                                       |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `privacy_policy`   | Link to the business's privacy policy             |
| `terms_of_service` | Link to the business's terms of service           |
| `refund_policy`    | Link to the business's refund policy              |
| `shipping_policy`  | Link to the business's shipping policy            |
| `faq`              | Link to the business's frequently asked questions |

Businesses **MAY** define custom types for domain-specific needs. Platforms
**SHOULD** handle unknown types gracefully by displaying them using the `title`
field or omitting them.

#### Rendering Contract

Businesses are the authoritative source for presented totals — their content
and order — because the correct presentation is subject to regional, product,
and regulatory requirements that the business is obligated to satisfy (e.g.,
multi-jurisdiction tax itemization, mandatory fee disclosures).

Platforms MUST render all top-level entries in the order provided:

```python
for entry in totals:
    render_line(entry.display_text, entry.amount)
```

Platforms MAY render sub-lines as supplementary detail:

```python
for entry in totals:
    render_line(entry.display_text, entry.amount)
    if entry.lines:
        for sub in entry.lines:
            render_detail_line(sub.display_text, sub.amount)
```

Platforms MUST NOT interpret, filter, reorder, aggregate, or apply display
logic of their own.

Invariants of `totals[]`:

* Every entry carries a `type` and an `amount`. Platforms SHOULD use
  `display_text` when provided. Well-known types have default display labels
  as fallback (see table below); unknown types MUST include `display_text`.
* Amounts are signed integers — negative values are subtractive (e.g.,
  discounts), positive values are additive. The sign IS the direction.
* Exactly one `type: "subtotal"` MUST be present.
* Exactly one `type: "total"` MUST be present.

#### Verification

Platforms MUST NOT substitute their own computed totals for the business's
values. Platforms MAY verify the provided totals:

```python
assert sum(e.amount for e in totals if e.type != "total") == total_entry.amount
```

If the computed sum does not match the `type: "total"` entry, the platform
MUST NOT alter the rendered output — the business's presented totals are
authoritative for display. However, platforms MUST NOT autonomously complete
a checkout with mismatched totals. Platforms SHOULD reject the checkout or
escalate and ask for buyer review via `continue_url`.

#### Well-Known Types

| Type              | Sign | Default label    | Meaning                                   |
| ----------------- | ---- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `subtotal`        | +    | Subtotal         | Sum of line item prices                   |
| `discount`        | −    | Discount         | Order or line-item level discount         |
| `items_discount`  | −    | Item Discounts   | Rollup of line-item discounts             |
| `fulfillment`     | +    | Shipping         | Shipping, delivery, or pickup charges     |
| `tax`             | +    | Tax              | Tax charges                               |
| `fee`             | +    | Fee              | Fees and surcharges                       |
| `total`           | =    | Total            | Authoritative grand total (exactly one)   |

When `display_text` is provided, platforms MUST use it. When omitted on a
well-known type, platforms SHOULD use the default label above. The sign
convention for well-known types is schema-enforced: subtractive types
(discount, items_discount) MUST have negative amounts; additive types
(subtotal, fulfillment, tax, fee) MUST have non-negative amounts.

The `type` field is an open string — businesses MAY use values beyond the
well-known set. Unknown types MUST include `display_text` (schema-enforced)
and the sign on the amount is self-describing.

#### Repeating Types

All types except `subtotal` and `total` MAY appear multiple times —
for example, multi-jurisdiction tax lines or itemized fees.

#### Sub-Lines (`lines`)

Each top-level entry MAY include a `lines` array. Sub-lines share the same
base shape as top-level entries — `display_text` and `amount` — providing an
itemized breakdown under the parent.

**Invariant:** `sum(lines[].amount)` MUST equal the parent entry's `amount`.

The business controls what MUST be rendered (top-level entries) versus what
MAY be optionally surfaced (sub-lines). Platforms SHOULD render sub-lines
when provided.

#### Examples

**Split tax, itemized at top-level:**

```json
"totals": [
  { "type": "subtotal",    "display_text": "Subtotal",    "amount": 5750 },
  { "type": "fulfillment", "display_text": "Shipping",    "amount": 899 },
  { "type": "tax",         "display_text": "Federal Tax", "amount": 332 },
  { "type": "tax",         "display_text": "State Tax",   "amount": 465 },
  { "type": "total",       "display_text": "Total",       "amount": 7446 }
]
```

**Collapsed fees with optional breakdown:**

```json
"totals": [
  { "type": "subtotal", "display_text": "Subtotal", "amount": 4999 },
  {
    "type": "fee", "display_text": "Fees", "amount": 549,
    "lines": [
      { "display_text": "Service Fee", "amount": 399 },
      { "display_text": "Recycling Fee", "amount": 150 }
    ]
  },
  { "type": "tax",   "display_text": "Tax",   "amount": 444 },
  { "type": "total", "display_text": "Total", "amount": 5992 }
]
```

**Discount and account credit — negative amounts:**

```json
"totals": [
  { "type": "subtotal",       "display_text": "Subtotal",       "amount": 10000 },
  { "type": "discount",       "display_text": "Summer Sale",    "amount": -1500 },
  { "type": "tax",            "display_text": "Tax",            "amount": 680 },
  { "type": "account_credit", "display_text": "Account Credit", "amount": -2500 },
  { "type": "total",          "display_text": "Amount Due",     "amount": 6680 }
]
```
